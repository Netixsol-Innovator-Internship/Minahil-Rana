Testimonials Grid Section â€“ Frontend Mentor Challenge

Overview

This project is a solution to the "Testimonials Grid Section" challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The goal was to create a responsive testimonials layout using HTML and Tailwind CSS based on the provided design specifications.

What I Did Today

- Set up the project structure with a basic `index.html` file and connected it with Tailwind CSS.
- Created a mobile-first responsive layout for testimonial cards using Tailwind utility classes.
- Implemented the grid layout to match the desktop design at 1440px width.
- Customized the Tailwind configuration file to include the style guide from the challenge:
  - Added custom colors (`purple`, `grey`, `darkblue`, `black`) as defined in the style guide.
  - Included the `Barlow Semi Condensed` font family and applied it globally.
  - Defined custom font size for body text (`13px`).
- Integrated the `Barlow Semi Condensed` font via a link tag in the HTML.
- Ensured full responsiveness and alignment with the design at various screen sizes.
- Tested layout and spacing across different screen widths.
